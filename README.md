LNAB is a linear algebra framework which focus on the matrix and vector operate. It made with expression, speed, and 
modularity in mind.

There are many function in LNAB's class MatrixOP like add, minus, mutiply, divide ,inverse and Gaussian Elimination. Not only just these function 
but also more and more linear algebra function will be add in the future.
